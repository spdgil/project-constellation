      "1": "This sector includes services and capabilities supporting critical minerals exploration, extraction, processing, and downstream component manufacturing. It excludes mineral rights ownership and focuses on industrial services, processing capability, and supply chain support. Critical minerals — including lithium, cobalt, vanadium, tungsten, copper, and rare earth elements — are the essential inputs for solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, advanced electronics, and defence systems. Queensland's decades-long expertise in base metals mining provides a strong foundation for establishing sustainable supply chains for newer critical minerals.\n\nThe global critical minerals market has doubled over the past five years to approximately $400 billion as of 2022, with the International Energy Agency forecasting demand to increase by 100–300% between 2020 and 2040. Lithium demand alone is forecast to be 40 times higher by 2040, and cobalt and graphite demand 20 times higher. Australia's projects in the pipeline are valued at between $30 billion and $42 billion, with up to 80% of the continent remaining underexplored. Queensland's North West Minerals Province alone holds an estimated $500 billion in deposits. The multi-criteria analysis scored critical minerals highest of all seven sectors at 24 out of 25, reflecting strong government priority at both state and federal levels, massive scale of opportunity, and high alignment with existing METS skills and capabilities.",
      "2": "The structural drivers of this opportunity are powerful and converging. The global energy transition creates enormous demand for the minerals that underpin clean technology manufacturing — batteries, solar cells, wind turbine components, and semiconductors. Simultaneously, geopolitical pressure is driving strategic supply chain reconfiguration away from concentrated sources, with governments worldwide seeking to build sovereign processing and manufacturing capability. Growing requirements for traceability, ethical sourcing, and environmental standards further advantage Australian producers with robust safety and quality records.\n\nDemand for battery storage, which is heavily reliant on critical minerals, is estimated to increase tenfold by 2030, with potential to generate up to $1.3 billion of economic activity in Queensland alone. Downstream refining and processing could generate an additional $140 billion in GDP between 2022 and 2040 nationally. The $5 billion Copperstring 2.0 transmission project will connect the North West Minerals Province to renewable energy zones on the east coast, unlocking processing capacity that was previously constrained by energy supply. Federal and state critical minerals strategies have aligned to prioritise domestic processing and value-adding, creating a policy environment that strongly supports investment in this sector.",
      "3": "The critical minerals sector is a high-value tradable enabler that links industrial capability to global supply chains and supports downstream manufacturing. It generates demand across the full spectrum of mining services — from geological surveying and precision extraction through to mineral processing, quality assurance, and advanced manufacturing. The sector's economic role extends beyond direct employment to catalysing broader industrial capability. Processing and manufacturing activities create higher-value jobs than extraction alone, with skills and infrastructure investments that spill over into adjacent sectors.\n\nFor the Greater Whitsunday region specifically, Queensland's ability to capitalise on the critical minerals opportunity is fundamentally reliant on the expertise of the METS sector. Current exploration surveys indicate critical minerals in Queensland are concentrated largely in the North West Minerals Province, with some smaller deposits within the Greater Whitsunday region itself. The Resources Centre of Excellence FlexiLab critical minerals processing plant, being developed in Paget with $5.7 million in Queensland Government funding, will become one of Australia's first commercial common-user facilities supporting activities around critical minerals, reprocessing of tailings, and other precious metals. Stage 2, the Future Industries Hub, is being developed with an additional $5.7 million to incubate new industries including critical minerals processing.",
      "4": "The critical minerals value chain spans upstream exploration and extraction, midstream processing and refining, and downstream component manufacturing and recycling. Each stage presents distinct opportunities for METS businesses. Upstream exploration and extraction provides the closest alignment with existing METS service offerings — integrated geological mapping, precision extraction capabilities, drilling and blasting, mine planning, and heavy equipment operation. Despite exploration expenditure on critical minerals growing by over 60% in 2022, 80% of Australia remains underexplored, meaning substantial upstream demand will persist for decades.\n\nGlobally, the supply chain is constrained at the processing and manufacturing stages, where markets are highly concentrated in a small number of countries. This creates the most significant long-term revenue opportunity aligned with government priorities — downstream processing and manufacturing of new economy products. The abundance of critical minerals across Queensland presents an opportunity to co-locate processing and manufacturing activities for outputs including batteries, solar cells, wind turbine components, and semiconductors. In the battery value chain specifically, significant opportunities exist in cell manufacturing, battery pack assembly, deployment, and recycling. Processing and refining are often the bottleneck, with high capital intensity and strict standards requirements, but this is precisely where the greatest value is captured.",
      "5": "Skills and capabilities across the METS sector have a high degree of alignment with the critical minerals value chain. Geological mapping and surveying, remote sensing, drilling and blasting, mine planning and design, safety and environmental compliance, mineral processing, electrical trades, quality control and assurance, and manufacturing and heavy equipment maintenance all rate as highly aligned to critical minerals requirements. This means that the existing METS workforce can participate meaningfully across the upstream value chain with minimal retraining.\n\nGaps exist primarily in the downstream processing and manufacturing segments. Metallurgical processes and techniques, and laboratory analysis of chemicals and materials, show moderate alignment — meaning the foundational skills exist but targeted upskilling is needed. Electrochemistry, chemical engineering, and robotics and automation show limited alignment to current METS capabilities and will require more substantial reskilling programmes. The metallurgical and chemical production processes underpinning processing and manufacturing opportunities will require particular attention in relation to the battery production value chain. As battery manufacturing is a nascent industry in Australia, a clear understanding of which parts of the value chain to focus on and the specific skill requirements is still being developed.",
      "6": "Several binding constraints affect sector participation and growth. First, there is a significant perception challenge: the critical minerals sector is perceived by METS businesses to be more relevant to the distant North West Minerals Province, with limited connection being made to local skills, equipment, and services. The distance from the Greater Whitsunday region is viewed as a particularly significant constraint, despite the region's METS businesses being well-positioned to service NWMP operations. Second, capital and resource constraints limit individual businesses' ability to invest in R&D for critical minerals service lines, especially when diverting scarce capital and labour from the currently strong coal services pipeline involves significant perceived opportunity costs.\n\nThird, there are substantial challenges in scaling processing and manufacturing from pilot to commercial stage — once viability is established through a pilot programme, the additional investment required for commercialisation is often difficult to source. Fourth, talent attraction is hampered by the sector's association with mining more broadly, with school leavers and graduates increasingly drawn to industries they see as more directly connected to a net-zero future. Fifth, the application of skills required for downstream processing and manufacturing requires greater understanding and targeted upskilling, particularly around working in controlled environments with specific knowledge of the differences between each mineral, where safety must be a primary focus.",
      "7": "The workforce spans the full range of mining and industrial occupations. At the upstream end, geological surveyors, drill operators, blasters, mine planners, and environmental compliance specialists are in high demand and directly transferable from existing METS operations. In midstream processing, the workforce extends to metallurgical and chemical engineers, process technicians, automation specialists, laboratory analysts, and quality assurance roles. Downstream manufacturing requires additional capability in electrochemistry, robotics, precision assembly, and quality systems aligned to manufacturing rather than mining standards.\n\nSkills transferability is a significant asset — many METS workers possess foundational competencies in mechanical and electrical trades, safety systems, heavy equipment operation, and project management that apply across the entire critical minerals value chain. However, the reskilling effort should not be underestimated, particularly for processing and manufacturing roles that require understanding of controlled chemical environments, contamination management, and the specific technical requirements of different minerals and their processing pathways. Stakeholders have identified a need to map specific skills gaps and explore micro-credentialling and transferable skills pathways with TAFE and universities.",
      "8": "Enabling conditions for successful sector development include common-user processing infrastructure that reduces capital barriers for individual businesses, particularly the FlexiLab and Future Industries Hub facilities at the Resources Centre of Excellence in Paget. Permitting clarity is essential — firms transitioning from coal services face unfamiliar regulatory pathways for minerals processing, including environmental impact assessments and compliance with evolving federal critical minerals policy. Skills pathways for processing must be developed collaboratively between industry, training providers, and government.\n\nCoordination across government and industry is needed to de-risk the scale-up from pilot to commercial operations, including access to shared infrastructure, risk-sharing mechanisms, and clear demand signals. Structured marketing and communication campaigns within schools, TAFE, and universities should articulate the vital importance of critical minerals to the energy transition while repositioning METS as a sector central to decarbonisation. Strategies to attract and prepare workforces, including overseas talent where necessary, are needed to support sector growth at the pace required by global demand.",
      "9": "The sector's evolution pathway moves from exploration and early extraction services — where METS businesses have the strongest immediate alignment — through to pilot processing and demonstration at facilities like the FlexiLab, then to commercial-scale processing and downstream manufacturing integration. Currently, the region is positioned at the early stages, with strong upstream capability and emerging processing infrastructure. The FlexiLab, while still in construction phase, has attracted high levels of interest from companies.\n\nThe maturity trajectory will be shaped by several factors: the pace of Copperstring 2.0 completion (unlocking energy supply for processing), the success of pilot processing programmes, the development of workforce skills in processing and manufacturing, and the clarity of government policy on domestic value-adding requirements. The most realistic near-term opportunities lie in leveraging existing METS capability for exploration and extraction services across Queensland's mineral provinces, while progressively building processing capability and workforce capacity for the higher-value downstream segments that represent the sector's long-term promise.",
      "10": "Strategic implications centre on five priorities. First, promote current and future critical minerals opportunities — particularly early-stage exploration and planning services — to local METS businesses, connecting regional diversification to better utilisation of skills, equipment, and technology for development in the North West Minerals Province. Second, progress opportunities to develop common-user infrastructure for processing, including partnerships to pilot, expand, and relocate processing infrastructure across the region. Third, deliver targeted communication campaigns to reposition METS as essential to the energy transition and attract talent.\n\nFourth, continue workforce attraction and preparation strategies, including overseas talent pipelines, to support sector growth at the required pace. Fifth, map specific skills gaps and develop micro-credentialling and transferable skills pathways with TAFE, universities, and industry RTOs. Strategies should focus on processing bottlenecks and shared infrastructure first, with clear positioning on where along the value chain regional participation is realistic and where longer-term capability building is required. The sector demands disciplined expectations about timelines while maintaining ambition about the scale of the ultimate opportunity."

      "1": "This sector encompasses the design, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance, and component manufacturing associated with large-scale renewable energy assets, including generation, storage, and transmission infrastructure. It excludes retailing and asset ownership, focusing on industrial services and asset lifecycle support. Queensland has set interim emissions targets of 75% below 2005 levels by 2035 and renewable energy targets of 70% of total generation by 2032 and 80% by 2035, with a range of policies, legislation, and roadmaps developed to achieve these targets.\n\nGlobal investment in the energy transition continues to grow rapidly, with the International Energy Agency estimating clean energy investment of $2.5 trillion in 2023, with over one-third ($960 billion) associated with renewable power. An estimated $12 trillion needs to be invested in renewable energy deployment globally between 2023 and 2030. In Queensland, the Energy and Jobs Plan estimates total capital investment of $62 billion to 2035, helping realise approximately $162 billion worth of renewable energy projects currently in the pipeline across solar, wind, and battery storage. The Greater Whitsunday region is receiving an estimated $1 billion in investment in over 500 megawatts of large-scale projects since 2015, with close to $8 billion in further investment estimated out to 2040.",
      "2": "Structural drivers include legislated decarbonisation targets at both state and federal levels, with aligned goals of achieving net zero by 2050. Falling technology costs for solar, wind, and battery storage continue to improve project economics, while grid modernisation needs create demand for transmission infrastructure, long-duration firming, and energy storage systems. Growth in variable renewable generation requires substantial investment in balancing technologies — pumped hydro, battery storage, and demand response systems — each generating sustained demand for engineering, construction, and maintenance services.\n\nThe Queensland Government's Energy and Jobs Plan provides the policy architecture for this transformation, committing to unprecedented levels of public and private investment. Major renewable projects slated for the Greater Whitsunday region include the Pioneer-Burdekin pumped hydro energy storage (PHES) and Capricornia Energy Hub projects. The Pioneer-Burdekin PHES, at 5,000 MW, would be the largest project of its kind in the world, supporting over 3,000 jobs during construction. Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners' Capricornia Energy Hub is a 1,400 MW project comprising PHES, wind, and solar assets, with the $2.5 billion PHES component expected to create approximately 600 construction jobs and 65 ongoing operations roles. Beyond these flagships, a further 30 solar, wind, and battery projects are proposed in the region with collective generation capacity exceeding 9 GW.",
      "3": "The renewable energy sector is an enabling productivity sector that generates durable demand for engineering, fabrication, construction, and technical services, often anchoring long-term employment through operations and maintenance. Investment in the sector will be a major driver of economic growth and opportunities in the Greater Whitsunday region in coming years. The industry is already well-established locally, and the pipeline of future investment creates a decades-long demand signal for industrial services.\n\nMETS businesses in the region identify strong similarities between many of the components they currently manufacture and repair for mines and those used in renewable assets such as wind turbines. This presents substantial opportunities for diversification, though businesses have tended to focus on the operations and maintenance phase as the primary opportunity, potentially underestimating construction-phase demand. Renewable energy project proponents engaged during the strategy development consider there to be significant opportunities for greater local involvement in component manufacturing — wind towers, nacelles and blades, solar PV modules and racks — areas where METS fabrication and engineering capabilities are directly applicable.",
      "4": "The typical value chain spans project development and approvals, construction and commissioning, component fabrication and logistics, then long-run operations, maintenance, refurbishment, and repowering. Value often concentrates in the construction and operations and maintenance phases, with higher barriers in specialised electrical works and manufacturing at scale. Transmission and pumped hydro projects require substantial earthmoving and related services including tunnelling and fabrication, with many opportunities not currently well understood by METS businesses.\n\nIn addition to the major public projects, extensive private-sector transmission infrastructure will be needed for renewable projects requiring grid connection. The construction phase of pumped hydro projects has a particularly high degree of skill transferability from METS, involving heavy civil works, mechanical fabrication, electrical installation, and project management at scale. During operations, the demand shifts to ongoing asset maintenance, electrical commissioning, and progressively to refurbishment and repowering as assets age — creating a multi-decade service opportunity. Linked Group Services in Paget exemplifies this transition, having started as a mining electrical contractor in 2010 and successfully diversified into commercial solar solutions, now locally manufacturing solar carport solutions, portable solar generators, and pipeline monitoring systems.",
      "5": "Capability requirements are broad, reflecting the scope and diversity of the sector. Civil and electrical engineering, mechanical and fabrication trades, heavy equipment maintenance, quality and safety systems, and compliance with grid and energy standards are foundational. Industrial land, logistics capacity, and heavy lifting capability are material enablers. Given the diversity of both the METS sector and the renewable energy requirements, there is likely a high degree of transferability across most skill categories.\n\nSpecifically, the Queensland Government's Future Energy Jobs Guide identifies a series of critical skill categories: electrical trades, construction roles including machinery operators and mechanical and fabrication trades, technicians including field, civil, and science technicians, engineers spanning multiple specialisations but particularly electrical and civil, science and technology professionals covering data and systems analysis and environmental science, and corporate functions including strategy, stakeholder engagement, and workplace health and safety. All of these categories have strong METS equivalents, though the specific application context differs.",
      "6": "Common constraints include shortages of specialised electrical and commissioning skills, procurement structures that favour incumbent international suppliers over local businesses, long lead times coupled with pipeline uncertainty, and standards complexity across multiple regulatory frameworks. Failure modes typically arise from skills bottlenecks and weak supply chain integration rather than lack of demand. A specific skills gap analysis identified critical competencies currently lacking in Queensland: electrical commissioning and substation isolation and installation (critical for extending the transmission network), skills to deliver pumped hydro energy storage (with limited skill available anywhere in Australia), and installing and maintaining grid-scale energy storage systems.\n\nA significant perception challenge exists: METS businesses tend to view their involvement as limited to the operations and maintenance phase, waiting for a critical mass of operational assets before engaging meaningfully. Given the long lead times for feasibility, design, and construction, this approach risks missing the substantial construction-phase opportunities. Additionally, opportunities for domestic component manufacturing are not being explored in detail — while proponents see potential, METS businesses face challenges around cost competitiveness relative to established international supply chains and uncertainty about whether proponents will procure locally. Procurement processes that break contracts into smaller packages accessible to local businesses would help address this barrier.",
      "7": "Workforce needs concentrate in technicians, trades workers, engineers, and machine operators. Many skills are transferable from heavy industry and infrastructure services, but grid connection, commissioning, and storage systems often require targeted upskilling and certification. The skills alignment is strong across most categories: electrical trades, machinery operations, mechanical and fabrication skills (welders, boilermakers, fitters), field and civil technicians, engineering across multiple disciplines, data analysis, environmental science, strategy and planning, workplace health and safety, and commercial analysis all rate as highly transferable.\n\nThe primary gap areas are specialised electrical services — commissioning, substation work, and grid-scale storage — and pumped hydro development and operations, which has limited skills availability across all of Australia. If the Pioneer-Burdekin PHES proceeds, it will require specialist skills and experience not currently widely available in the region, necessitating proactive workforce planning, targeted training programme development, and potentially attraction of international expertise during the construction phase to build local capability.",
      "8": "Enabling conditions include regulatory clarity and consistent standards across the renewable energy and grid connection regulatory frameworks, workforce development programmes aligned to specific project phases rather than generic training, suitable industrial infrastructure including fabrication facilities and logistics capacity, and coordination mechanisms linking proponents, suppliers, and training providers. The region needs proactive engagement with the pipeline of projects to ensure METS businesses are positioned to participate across the full value chain.\n\nSpecific priorities include identifying and defining skills requirements and gaps for pumped hydro and transmission projects, implementing actions to prepare the region and METS businesses for these opportunities, working with stakeholders to articulate specific electrical services skills gaps and explore provision pathways, encouraging METS businesses to take up reskilling and upskilling opportunities, and engaging with renewable proponents to advocate for procurement processes that provide opportunities for local businesses — including breaking down contract packages into smaller components that allow local businesses to tender. Support for advanced manufacturing capability is also important to enable the transition from service provision to component manufacturing.",
      "9": "The sector is progressing from established pilot deployments and early-stage large-scale construction to a period of rapid scaling with acute skills demand and supply chain stress. The current pipeline — including the potential Pioneer-Burdekin PHES, Capricornia Energy Hub, and 30+ proposed solar, wind, and battery projects — suggests the next decade will see the most intensive construction activity. This will be followed by a maturity phase characterised by stable operations, asset management, refurbishment, and eventually repowering cycles as first-generation assets reach end-of-life.\n\nFor METS businesses, the strategic window for engaging with the construction phase is now — waiting for operations and maintenance demand means missing the largest near-term opportunity. The transition to maturity creates a different but equally valuable long-term demand profile: ongoing maintenance contracts, equipment overhaul cycles, technology upgrades, and eventually full asset refurbishment and repowering programmes that leverage deep industrial services capability.",
      "10": "Strategic implications centre on broadening METS engagement beyond the operations and maintenance phase. Priorities include collating and articulating the pipeline of renewable projects across the state — particularly those proximate to the Greater Whitsunday region — and developing mechanisms for communicating skills and expertise requirements to METS businesses. Understanding the opportunities in transmission and pumped hydro construction is critical, as these projects require capabilities that closely match existing METS strengths.\n\nEquipping METS businesses to meet specialised electrical trades demands through targeted training and credentialling, supporting domestic component manufacturing ambitions through procurement reform and advanced manufacturing capability development, and treating the sector as services-led and enablement-focused rather than ownership-led are all essential strategic postures. The region should anticipate industrial land and infrastructure pressure as the pipeline accelerates, and invest in coordination capacity to connect the fragmented landscape of proponents, contractors, suppliers, and training providers into a coherent regional response."

      "1": "This sector includes production systems and industrial services supporting bioenergy and biofuels, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), renewable diesel, bioethanol, and related biorefining activities. The global bioenergy market is forecast to grow from $63 billion to between $181 billion (base case) and $726 billion (net zero scenario) by 2050. In Australia, the sector could contribute an additional $10 billion per year in GDP and 26,200 new jobs by the early 2030s. The Australian SAF industry alone could be worth $3 billion annually and create up to 15,600 jobs nationwide by 2050.\n\nThe bioenergy sector is already well-established in the Greater Whitsunday region, particularly in bioethanol production, given the close proximity to feedstock sources including waste and byproducts from sugar manufacturing, grains, oil seeds, tallow, aquaculture waste, and algae. The Queensland Government has repeatedly committed to the Greater Whitsunday region as key to unleashing Queensland's biofutures potential since the Biofutures 10-Year Roadmap and Action Plan 2016–2026. Many METS businesses already service the bioenergy sector to some degree through their existing relationships with the sugar industry.",
      "2": "Drivers include decarbonisation constraints in hard-to-electrify sectors such as aviation and shipping, combined with policy support for renewable fuels and biomass utilisation. These sectors cannot be readily electrified with current technology, creating durable demand for liquid biofuels — particularly SAF, which is increasingly mandated by airline commitments and government policy. Growing circular economy requirements and waste-to-energy policy frameworks add further demand drivers.\n\nThe Mackay State Development Area (SDA), a 907-hectare area declared in February 2024 across the Racecourse Mill and Rosella sites, has been established to become Queensland's home of an emerging biocommodity industry. This strategic land allocation, combined with existing infrastructure including the Wilmar Biorefinery at Sarina (producing approximately 60 million litres of ethanol annually), the QUT Mackay Renewable Biocommodities Pilot Plant (undergoing a $16 million upgrade), and the Racecourse Cogeneration Plant (powering approximately 30% of Mackay through bagasse), positions the region with unique competitive advantages in bioenergy production.",
      "3": "Bioenergy can provide stable industrial demand and create value through conversion of biomass and byproducts into fuels and energy, supporting regional resilience where feedstock systems exist. The sector diversifies the economic base while leveraging existing agricultural and industrial waste streams, converting what would otherwise be disposal costs into revenue-generating products. For the Greater Whitsunday region, the co-location of sugar processing infrastructure, abundant feedstock, and industrial services capability creates a distinctive value proposition.\n\nThe economic role extends beyond direct production to enabling infrastructure development, creating demand for process engineering services, mechanical and fabrication trades, electrical installation, and ongoing plant maintenance. The sector also drives investment in logistics systems, storage infrastructure, and quality assurance capabilities that have positive spillovers into adjacent industrial activities.",
      "4": "The value chain spans feedstock aggregation and management, preprocessing and handling, conversion and refining, logistics and distribution, and ongoing operations and maintenance of facilities. Each stage presents specific opportunities for METS businesses. Feedstock logistics — collection, transport, storage, and preprocessing — requires heavy equipment, logistics management, and handling systems aligned to existing METS capabilities. Conversion and refining involves process engineering, controlled environment operations, and specialised equipment that demands fabrication, installation, and maintenance services.\n\nThe QUT Mackay Renewable Biocommodities Pilot Plant, located at Nordzucker Mackay Sugar Limited's Racecourse Mill, converts biomass into biofuels, green chemicals, and other bioproducts using Mercurius REACH technology. Its $16 million upgrade, co-invested by state and federal governments, will make it a key testing ground for commercial pathways. As SAF production moves from pilot to commercial scale, the demand for construction trades, process equipment fabrication, and plant operations and maintenance will scale proportionally.",
      "5": "Capability requirements include process engineering, mechanical and fabrication services (welders, boilermakers, fitters), electrical trades, operations and maintenance, logistics, and in some segments scientific capability related to feedstock characterisation and conversion pathways. Construction of new bioenergy facilities draws heavily on standard METS fabrication and installation skills, while ongoing operations require adapted process knowledge. Transportation and logistics, manufacturing and laboratory technicians, and engineering across chemical, mechanical, biological, and electrical disciplines are all needed.\n\nThe skills and capabilities of the METS sector are highly transferable for construction and operations and maintenance of bioenergy facilities. However, the sector also requires more niche skills specific to bioenergy — microbiology, biochemistry, and agricultural science and biomass production management — that are not currently widely held within METS businesses and will require dedicated training pathways.",
      "6": "Key constraints include feedstock logistics and competition for biomass resources, technology uncertainty across conversion pathways (with multiple competing approaches at varying stages of commercial readiness), and skills gaps in biochemical and process operations. METS stakeholders tend to view bioenergy through the lens of competition with agriculture for feedstock, with limited awareness of contemporary processes that use byproducts of food production rather than primary crops.\n\nThere is limited understanding among METS businesses of future demand for biofuels and recent trends, particularly drivers likely to underpin demand for SAF in aviation and shipping. Bioenergy tends to be associated with the agriculture sector, which is not currently perceived by METS businesses as a source of profitability. Failure modes include scale constraints from feedstock availability, insufficient demand aggregation to justify commercial-scale investment, and inability to bridge the gap between pilot demonstration and commercial production where capital requirements escalate significantly.",
      "7": "The workforce spans trades and technicians for construction and maintenance, process operators, engineers, and specialist roles in feedstock systems. For SAF production specifically, immediate skills requirements focus on project planning and construction — construction and electrical trades, metal workers and assemblers, and engineers. As the sector moves into operations and maintenance, requirements shift toward processing and handling of inputs, machinery maintenance and repair (industrial machinery and mobile equipment mechanics), and production occupations (welders, boilermakers, plant operators).\n\nA degree of reskilling will be required for METS workers to understand and work effectively in bioenergy contexts, though the foundational trade skills are strongly aligned. The gap is primarily in scientific and process-specific knowledge rather than hands-on technical capability. Training providers, including CQUniversity, TAFE Queensland, and specialist RTOs, will need to develop programmes that bridge the gap between existing mining services competencies and bioenergy process operations.",
      "8": "Enabling conditions include stable demand signals from hard-to-electrify industries (particularly airlines and shipping companies committing to SAF procurement), feedstock coordination that ensures reliable supply chains without competing with food production, permitting clarity for new bioenergy facilities, and capability to operate in controlled industrial environments with safety and quality requirements. The Mackay SDA provides the strategic land-use framework, while existing facilities like the Wilmar Biorefinery and QUT Pilot Plant demonstrate the region's established bioenergy infrastructure.\n\nSpecific enabling actions include developing tools and strategies to deliver key information around bioenergy opportunities to METS businesses, working with stakeholders to understand needs and demands for SAF and other biofuels and articulating these to industry, identifying and promoting successful local case studies demonstrating commercial viability, and continuing to monitor and communicate bioenergy sector opportunities as they emerge and evolve.",
      "9": "The typical evolution moves from demonstration and pilot conversion — where the region is currently well-positioned through the QUT Pilot Plant and Wilmar Biorefinery — to commercial facilities, then to scale through replication and supply chain optimisation. The Mackay SDA declaration signals government intent to accelerate the transition from pilot to commercial, providing the land-use certainty needed for major investment decisions.\n\nThe SAF subsector is at a particularly dynamic inflection point globally. As airline mandates for sustainable fuel blending increase and government policy sharpens, the economic case for commercial-scale SAF production strengthens. The Greater Whitsunday region's combination of feedstock availability, pilot infrastructure, industrial services capability, and strategic land allocation positions it to be an early mover in Australian SAF production. The maturity pathway beyond initial commercialisation involves product diversification across biofuels, biochemicals, and bioplastics.",
      "10": "Strategic implications include clarifying feedstock systems and ensuring that regional supply chains for biomass are well-understood and reliably aggregated, aligning skills to process operations through targeted training programmes that bridge METS capability into bioenergy contexts, and coordinating demand signals from hard-to-electrify industries so that investment decisions can be made with confidence. The region should leverage its existing bioenergy assets as demonstration platforms while actively pursuing commercial-scale opportunities.\n\nCommunication with METS businesses is particularly important given current perception gaps. Information campaigns should focus on the scale of the SAF opportunity, the alignment of existing skills to bioenergy construction and operations, and the commercial viability demonstrated by local operations. Case studies from businesses that have successfully diversified into bioenergy servicing should be promoted widely. Engagement with national and international SAF procurement processes can help generate the demand signals needed to underpin commercial investment."

      "1": "This sector includes industrial bioprocessing and precision fermentation for production of food ingredients, chemicals, enzymes, alternative proteins, and related products. It focuses on manufacturing capability rather than research alone. The global biomanufacturing market is forecast to grow from $11.8 billion in 2021 to over $700 billion by 2040. Australia's biomanufacturing sector has potential to generate $29 billion annually and 50,000 new jobs by 2040, with the Queensland Government forecasting the sector could contribute over $4 billion to gross state product by 2035.\n\nPrecision fermentation is of particular interest in the Greater Whitsunday region currently, with investigations underway to explore feasibility of scaling this technology commercially. The region's investment attraction for biomanufacturing companies is enhanced by the opportunity to co-locate with abundant and diverse feedstock profiles, led largely by the sugar industry. Between 2021 and 2023, Australia attracted over $363 million in private capital for biomanufacturing companies, with 80% of investments directed toward agriculture and food companies, indicating strong commercial interest in the sector's growth trajectory.",
      "2": "Drivers include growing demand for lower-carbon inputs to food and industrial products, supply chain resilience concerns accelerated by pandemic disruptions, rapid advances in synthetic biology that are reducing production costs, and growth in alternative proteins and novel ingredients driven by consumer preferences and sustainability requirements. Regulatory frameworks are adapting globally to accommodate precision fermentation products, with Australia's food standards system progressively developing pathways for novel food ingredients.\n\nThe Queensland Government considers the state ideally placed to become an Asia-Pacific hub for biomanufacturing of future foods and bioproducts. The state has committed over $1 million in funding to support the development of a business case to attract organisations to co-develop a $300 million Future Food Biohub in the Mackay SDA. Cauldron Ferm, a leading precision fermentation company, is developing a large-scale facility in Mackay as part of this project, with the Queensland Government contributing $528,000 toward the business case. Critically, Cauldron Ferm publicly stated that the strong alignment of skills in the mining and METS sector was a major factor in their decision to consider investment in Mackay.",
      "3": "Biomanufacturing can add significant value through high-margin manufacturing, creating skilled jobs and enabling export-capable products where quality standards are met. The sector creates demand for advanced process engineering, precision fabrication, controlled-environment operations, and quality assurance systems — all areas where METS capability can be meaningfully applied. Unlike traditional agriculture, which is seasonal and often perceived by METS businesses as less profitable, biomanufacturing operates year-round with industrial production rhythms closer to mining services than to farming.\n\nBiomanufacturing stakeholders engaged during strategy development suggested the industry offers strong alignment with METS capabilities, especially in manufacturing and fabrication. The seasonality associated with agriculture that has historically deterred METS businesses is much less pronounced in biomanufacturing, where continuous industrial production is the norm. The sector's economic contribution extends through multiple applications: food, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, enzymes, alternative proteins, and even repurposing of industrial waste streams.",
      "4": "The value chain includes feedstock inputs (sugars, starches, and other biological substrates), fermentation and processing (the core biomanufacturing step), quality control and product testing, packaging and logistics, then market access and distribution. Considering Mackay is the proposed site for the $300 million Future Foods BioHub and Cauldron Ferm's plant, skills requirements in the region will centre around food and related products in the near term.\n\nThe QUT Mackay Renewable Biocommodities Pilot Plant is undergoing a $16 million expansion, supported by the Queensland Government's Industry Partnership Programme, the Australian Government, the Food and Beverage Accelerator, and QUT. The upgrades will make the Pilot Plant Australia's only facility capable of demonstrating synthetic biology processes at full scale, providing a hub for innovation and fast-tracking food and beverage development. This positions the Greater Whitsunday region with unique capabilities in the pilot-to-commercial pathway that is often the most critical bottleneck for biomanufacturing ventures.",
      "5": "Capability requirements include fabrication and maintenance of process equipment, controlled-environment operations, food-grade or GMP-compliant processes, quality assurance, and specialist bioprocess engineering. There is immense scope for METS businesses to apply their skills in manufacturing, fabrication, and maintenance — the strong history of METS businesses servicing the agriculture and ethanol production sectors provides a head start. Specific capabilities include manufacture of fermentation vessels, maintenance and repair of machinery and equipment, quality control and product testing, industrial cleaning, and robotics and automation.\n\nHowever, the sector also requires capabilities not currently widespread in the METS workforce. Food-grade certification for equipment and facilities is essential — equipment used to service mining products cannot be used for food applications without requisite certifications. Upskilling is needed in microbiology, biochemistry, bioprocess engineering and fermentation technology, operating in controlled environments, moisture and compositional sensing technology, food safety and regulatory compliance, and predictive maintenance for sensitive biological processes.",
      "6": "Key constraints include certification requirements — METS companies do not yet have food-grade certification and equipment, representing a meaningful barrier to entry. Biomanufacturing is knowledge-intensive and in its infancy in Australia, suggesting a generally limited level of understanding around technical concepts such as microbiology, biochemistry, bioprocess engineering, and precision fermentation. Standards for contamination control are stringent, and the gap between mining-grade and food-grade operations requires deliberate investment to bridge.\n\nAlthough the industry requires advanced scientific skills, the number of employees required in process operations will outnumber scientists by several times. METS businesses have strong capabilities in optimising mining operations, but there is a gap in understanding how these capabilities transfer to a biomanufacturing context. Failure modes include inability to meet food-grade standards at scale, weak downstream market access for novel products in a still-developing regulatory environment, and underestimating the investment required to obtain and maintain certifications.",
      "7": "The workforce spans process operators, lab technicians, engineers, quality specialists, and maintenance trades adapted to controlled environments. Microbiology, food science, and chemistry skills are needed to optimise feedstock for production. Bioprocess engineering applied to biological systems, engineering, design and fabrication of fermentation vessels and general plant, and operations and maintenance with a particular focus on predictive maintenance are all critical. Understanding of overseas markets and demand for products is important for export-oriented production.\n\nThe complex nature of the manufacturing process lends itself to robotics and automation technologies, an area where some METS businesses have existing capability that can be extended. Services to monitor operations and output — including quality control, product testing, and compositional sensing — align well with existing METS quality assurance capabilities, though adaptation to biological rather than mineral contexts is required.",
      "8": "Enabling conditions include access to appropriate facilities that meet food-grade or GMP standards, certification and accreditation pathways that METS businesses can navigate efficiently, training aligned to process operations in controlled biological environments, and collaboration between industry, universities (particularly QUT and CQUniversity), and TAFE institutions. The Mackay SDA and Future Food BioHub provide the spatial and institutional framework.\n\nSpecific enabling actions include identifying food-grade skills requirements and working with stakeholders to streamline skills gaps, mapping specific needs and exploring micro-credentialling solutions, leveraging the expertise of universities and TAFE to develop customised training modules for METS businesses diversifying into biomanufacturing, and facilitating opportunities to increase METS understanding of biomanufacturing processes and sector alignment. The presence of Cauldron Ferm as an anchor tenant creates opportunities for apprenticeship and skills transfer programmes embedded within a commercial operation.",
      "9": "The typical pathway moves from pilot and demonstration facilities — where the region has a strong position through the QUT Pilot Plant and its $16 million upgrade — to first commercial plants (the Cauldron Ferm and Future Food BioHub developments), then to network-scale production and product diversification. The region is currently transitioning from the pilot phase to the first commercial deployment phase, with the BioHub representing the critical scaling step.\n\nThe maturity trajectory depends on several factors: successful commissioning of the BioHub and Cauldron Ferm facility, development of a workforce trained in food-grade biomanufacturing, establishment of export market access for novel products, and continued feedstock availability and cost competitiveness. The long-term vision is a biomanufacturing precinct in the Mackay SDA that attracts multiple companies, creates a cluster of complementary capabilities, and positions the Greater Whitsunday region as a national hub for industrial-scale precision fermentation.",
      "10": "Strategic implications include prioritising standards readiness — helping METS businesses understand and obtain the food-grade certifications required to participate in biomanufacturing supply chains. Workforce pathways for controlled-environment operations are essential, with training programmes needing to bridge the gap between mining-grade and food-grade operating standards. The enabling infrastructure for scale — including the BioHub, pilot plant, and SDA — must be supported with coordinated investment in utilities, waste management, and logistics.\n\nThe opportunity is significant but requires realistic expectations about the timeline for METS businesses to participate meaningfully in precision fermentation. The near-term opportunities are in facility construction, equipment fabrication, and plant maintenance — areas where existing METS skills apply most directly. Deeper participation in process operations will require the workforce development and certification investments described above. The anchor investment by Cauldron Ferm provides the demand signal and commercial context that makes these investments worthwhile."

      "1": "This sector includes services and business models that extend product life, enable refurbishment, repurposing, recycling, and material recovery within industrial supply chains. A circular economy approach could unlock $6.5 trillion of value globally by 2030, surging to $36 trillion by 2050. If circular economy models are adopted in Australia, over $1.8 trillion in direct economic benefits could accrue over two decades, with over $700 billion to Queensland, while saving over 165 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2040.\n\nAustralia's circularity rate has increased only slightly from 3.5% in 2015 to 4% in 2023 — half the global average — suggesting significant untapped potential. A key circular practice applicable to mining — reprocessing of tailings — represents a $4.9 trillion opportunity globally. The Greater Whitsunday region features broad and integrated value chains for key industries such as mining and agriculture, and the implementation of the $4 million Queensland Circular Economy (Industry-Research) Programme through the Resources Centre of Excellence demonstrates government commitment to realising regional growth in the circular economy.",
      "2": "Drivers include escalating waste reduction requirements and community expectations, cost pressure on industrial inputs, carbon accounting obligations that penalise linear consumption models, and growing demand for circular procurement and lifecycle performance from major buyers. As global supply chains face resource constraints and price volatility, businesses that can extract more value from existing materials gain competitive advantage.\n\nThe Greater Whitsunday region is one of the highest off-road tyre generating regions in the country, presenting immediate opportunities for new service offerings to extend tyre useful life or develop new uses for discarded tyres. The Resources Centre of Excellence has launched a pilot programme with BHP Mitsubishi Alliance to understand the scope for integrating circular principles across the entire mining value chain — one of the first projects of its kind nationally, including comprehensive material flow analysis to identify impact hotspots and catalytic circular opportunities. The qualitative and quantitative analysis will provide a robust framework for future actions including scalable opportunities.",
      "3": "Circular economy activity can improve productivity through reduced material intensity, new service models, and retention of value in local supply chains. Research indicates that 80% of a product's environmental impact is locked in during the initial design and manufacturing stages, creating an enormous opportunity to design out waste from the outset. METS businesses with advanced manufacturing capabilities and deep understanding of product componentry are well-positioned to apply circular product design principles — design for disassembly, modularity, and material recovery.\n\nCurrently, many METS businesses are already proactively engaging in initiatives to rethink, reuse, repair, repurpose, and recycle. Many are adopting circular initiatives internally for cost savings or efficiency gains, indicating significant capacity to extend these practices into market-facing products and services. METS businesses take particular pride in manufacturing products designed to be repaired and refurbished, with a strength in preventative maintenance. Some have innovated further to integrate technology, creating robust solutions. Consolidated Engineering Plastics Products, for example, has implemented circular thinking by repurposing offcuts from conveyor guards into a range of saleable products.",
      "4": "The value chain includes product design and lifecycle planning, maintenance and refurbishment services, material recovery and processing, then reintegration into supply chains. Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) models represent a particularly significant opportunity — METS businesses already specialise in proactive and predictive maintenance that ensures equipment runs optimally and product life is extended. Converting this from an internal practice to a market offering creates new recurring revenue streams.\n\nDesigning out waste through circular product design (design for disassembly, modularity) leverages METS advanced manufacturing capabilities. Repurposing and refurbishment of waste products — mining produces waste in substantial quantities from various activities — presents opportunities for value creation through conversion into higher-value products. In the mining and METS context, opportunities exist to repurpose waste such as tailings, metal waste, plastic, chemicals, tyres, and packaging. A comprehensive understanding of the potential applications of recovered materials in new products is required.",
      "5": "Capability requirements include maintenance and repair capability (high alignment with METS), materials analysis, lifecycle thinking, logistics, and compliance with waste regulations. Product manufacturing and business innovation capabilities — both METS strengths — are central to circular economy participation. Environmental engineering, supply chain and logistics management, and value chain collaboration require moderate adaptation from existing METS competencies.\n\nThe key capability gaps are in lifecycle thinking skills (limited alignment) — the holistic consideration of entire product and material lifecycles that underpins circular system design. While METS businesses possess deep specialisation across mining supply chain activities, applying circular principles requires different thinking that takes a broader view of the value chain across mining and adjacent industries. Waste and circularity regulation and compliance also represents a gap, as the regulatory landscape for reuse and repurposing differs significantly from mining operations compliance.",
      "6": "Constraints include regulatory restrictions on waste handling — stringent mine-site control practices restrict some waste from being reused and repurposed, with tight restrictions on suppliers regarding intervening on site and returning materials. Limited lifecycle thinking skills within METS businesses, with many focused on the lower rungs of the 'R ladder' (recycling) rather than higher-value strategies (rethink, reduce, reuse, repair). Logistical cost and limited site access also constrain the ability to identify and implement circular solutions at mine sites.\n\nThere is limited understanding of downstream customer interest and demand for Product-as-a-Service models and the broader value of circularity. While most businesses apply circularity principles internally, they don't understand the potential of providing this as a market offering. Knowledge gaps exist about the potential uses of waste materials in alternative products, including the regulation and compliance requirements around waste management for reuse and repurposing. Failure modes include being trapped at low-value recycling rather than progressing to higher-value refurbishment, reuse, and circular service models.",
      "7": "The workforce includes technicians, engineers, logistics roles, and specialists in materials analysis and compliance. Repair and maintenance technicians, product manufacturing specialists, and business innovators are the most directly transferable METS roles. Design for recovery and multiple-use cycles, materials analysis, waste conversion assessment, environmental engineering, and supply chain management require moderate upskilling.\n\nThe METS sector's entrepreneurial strengths and deep technical expertise, combined with substantial interest in understanding broader value chain opportunities, align well with the key success factors for implementing circular economy principles. The workforce development priority is building lifecycle thinking capability — training METS professionals to see beyond individual product or service transactions to the full material and value lifecycle. This represents a strategic thinking shift more than a technical skills gap.",
      "8": "Enabling conditions include regulatory clarity for reuse — including advocating for adaptation of waste management regulations to enable innovative repurposing strategies while maintaining environmental standards. Access to mine sites and material streams is essential, as is demand from large buyers for circular products and services. Coordination across value chains — connecting waste generators with potential value-adders — is a systemic enabler.\n\nSpecific actions include highlighting regional circular economy findings and communicating them to METS businesses, identifying opportunities to increase lifecycle and circular thinking skills, working with stakeholders to identify demand for alternative business models aligned to circular principles, connecting businesses with avenues to explore these opportunities, collaborating with mine operators and government to adapt waste management regulations, and partnering with stakeholders to provide information about potential uses of waste materials through case studies, reports, and information sessions.",
      "9": "Maturity often progresses from internal efficiency initiatives (where many METS businesses already operate), to circular service offerings (Product-as-a-Service, refurbishment contracts, materials recovery), to integrated circular business models operating at scale across multiple clients and material streams. The Resources Centre of Excellence / BHP pilot programme represents the transition from internal efficiency to structured analysis of value chain-wide opportunities.\n\nThe region's maturity will be shaped by the success of early pilot programmes in demonstrating commercial viability, regulatory evolution to support rather than constrain circular practices, and the development of demand signals from major buyers (mining companies, government procurement) for circular products and services. The long-term vision involves a regional circular economy ecosystem where waste streams from mining, agriculture, and industry are systematically captured, processed, and reintegrated into productive use.",
      "10": "Strategic implications focus on moving up the R-ladder from recycling to higher-value circular strategies. Priorities include enabling regulatory pathways that support rather than constrain material reuse and repurposing, developing lifecycle thinking and systems design skills within the METS workforce, and coordinating demand for circular products and services from major industrial buyers.\n\nThe region should leverage its concentrated industrial activity and deep METS capability as competitive advantages — few regions combine the scale of material flows, the technical workforce, and the manufacturing flexibility needed for circular economy leadership. Building on the Resources Centre of Excellence pilot programme with BHP to develop scalable frameworks for circular practices across the mining sector would position the Greater Whitsunday region as a national demonstration site for industrial circularity."

The global space economy is estimated to be worth $2.6 trillion by 2035, up from $915 billion in 2023. Australia's space industry generated $4.5 billion in revenue in 2021, with the Australian Space Agency targeting a tripling to $12 billion per annum and 20,000 additional jobs by 2030. Queensland's space industry is estimated to have potential to add between $3.5 billion and $6 billion annually to the state economy by 2036.\n\nThe Greater Whitsunday region's desirable location and renowned technical capability is attracting investment from space organisations. The Bowen area has been identified by the Queensland Government as ideally suited for the space industry based on technical and environmental criteria: proximity to the equator with capability to launch multiple orbits, lower population density, minimal ocean activity near the launch site, and existing infrastructure including a deep-sea port, long runway, proximity to a major hospital, and road and rail network. The Bowen Orbital Spaceport, co-funded by the Australian and Queensland Governments and Gilmour Space Technologies, was granted a launch facility licence in March 2024 — making it one of only three dedicated orbital launch sites globally.",
      "2": "Drivers include rapid growth in satellite deployment worldwide, constrained global launch capacity, and increased national investment in space capability and sovereign infrastructure. The current global space economy (Space 2.0) is being progressed by innovative private organisations working in concert with governments to support satellite launch, control robotics, and Earth observation. There are approximately $8 billion in satellite programmes currently planned for Australia.\n\nThe Australian Space Agency, established in July 2018, has set ambitious growth targets that create policy support for domestic capability development. Half of the world's top ten aerospace companies have a presence in Queensland, providing potential anchor demand for local supply chain participants. The convergence of commercial space growth, sovereign capability imperatives, and regional infrastructure investment creates a window of opportunity for the Greater Whitsunday region to establish itself as a meaningful participant in the space supply chain.",
      "3": "Space industry support can create high-quality manufacturing and engineering demand with strong spillovers into adjacent high-standards industries. The skills, quality systems, and manufacturing precision developed for space applications transfer directly to defence, medical devices, advanced electronics, and other sectors where standards and reliability requirements are paramount.\n\nFor the Greater Whitsunday region, the space sector represents a long-term diversification opportunity that leverages the region's engineering and fabrication strengths while pushing capabilities toward higher-value, higher-standards manufacturing. A local space business noted that many products and skills associated with the METS sector are directly applicable, with manufacturing services from some METS businesses already being procured. Valmar Engineering, a Greater Whitsunday company established in 2013 with experience in sugar and mining fabrication, has been engaged by Gilmour Space since September 2023 to fabricate the transport erector and components that take the 30-tonne rocket from horizontal to vertical position at the Bowen Orbital Spaceport.",
      "4": "The value chain spans component manufacturing, systems integration, ground infrastructure construction and maintenance, operations and maintenance of launch and tracking facilities, and downstream data services. Space manufacturing encompasses building and integration of ground-based facilities and equipment, plus maintenance of these assets. Space operations include management of objects in space and activities associated with satellite deployment and control. Space applications involve using space-derived resources and services to add value to other economic sectors.\n\nFor METS businesses, the most immediate entry points are in component fabrication (leveraging existing metal and mechanical fabrication capabilities), ground infrastructure construction and maintenance (leveraging civil and heavy engineering experience), and supporting logistics for launch operations. As the sector matures and local capability develops, deeper participation in systems integration and higher-complexity manufacturing becomes feasible.",
      "5": "Capability requirements include high-quality fabrication and precision manufacturing, engineering across aerospace, avionics, mechatronics, and electrical disciplines, adherence to strict international standards, and quality assurance systems aligned to ISO and defence-like requirements. The SmartSat Cooperative Research Centre identified 319 skills required in the space industry, of which 310 were in shortage nationally — indicating an enormous workforce development opportunity.\n\nMETS skills with high alignment include manufacturing and heavy equipment maintenance, electrical trades, mechanical and fabrication skills (welders, boilermakers, fitters), and plant operations. Moderate alignment exists for engineering specialisations (aerospace, avionics, mechatronics), data analysis and IT, robotics and automation, transportation and logistics, assembly and production test technicians, and safety design competencies. Notable synergy exists between METS safety design capabilities and space operations requirements — spacecraft mechanism design, habitation structures, and debris shielding correlate with mining safety design tasks.",
      "6": "Constraints include high regulatory and standards barriers — the quality requirements of the space sector mean METS businesses must complete resource-intensive international accreditations (e.g. ISO) that many perceive as a significant barrier. Limited near-term demand visibility is a concern, as the current scale of space industry activity in the region is small relative to mining, and the number of launches planned is limited in the short term. Accreditation costs are substantial, and there is limited understanding among METS businesses of the supporting infrastructure and services required to maximise the potential of the Bowen Orbital Spaceport.\n\nMany METS businesses expressed interest in the space sector but could not make a clear link between their existing capabilities and future requirements. The sector's demanding quality standards, while similar in philosophy to mining safety standards, require different certification frameworks and documentation practices. Failure modes include inability to meet standards at the required level, insufficient market scale for early entrants to recoup accreditation investments, and misjudging which capabilities are genuinely transferable versus those that require more fundamental retraining.",
      "7": "The workforce includes engineers, technicians, production and test roles, quality specialists, and increasingly data and automation professionals. The Australian Space Agency's Civil Space Strategy identified nurturing STEM skills as a key strategic pillar, while space sector stakeholders interviewed during strategy development identified relevant transferable skills already available in the Greater Whitsunday region — particularly related to plant operations, filling systems, and broader maintenance requirements.\n\nThree core skill categories are required: space manufacturing skills (component fabrication, integration, testing), space operations skills (facility management, launch support, tracking), and space applications skills (data processing, remote sensing, downstream analytics). The METS workforce has strongest alignment with manufacturing and operations, with more significant development needed for applications and the specialised engineering disciplines unique to aerospace.",
      "8": "Enabling conditions include standards pathways that help METS businesses navigate accreditation efficiently, supplier accreditation support modelled on processes used to enter the defence supply chain, and clear procurement requirements from space operators and prime contractors. The Bowen Orbital Spaceport licence provides the physical infrastructure anchor, but the supply chain development requires deliberate facilitation.\n\nSpecific enabling actions include developing stakeholder engagement plans to connect METS businesses to space sector opportunities, identifying the skills and qualifications necessary for enhancing existing capabilities, mapping accreditation pathways, and working with Gilmour Space and other operators to articulate procurement requirements in terms that METS businesses can respond to. The defence supply chain entry model — where structured programmes help manufacturers achieve required certifications — provides a useful template for space sector workforce and capability development.",
      "9": "Maturity typically progresses from limited supply roles and bespoke fabrication — where the region currently sits, with companies like Valmar Engineering providing specific components — to repeatable contracts and qualified supplier status, to broader integration and operations support ecosystems. The current phase is characterised by one-off engagements and exploratory relationships between space companies and METS providers.\n\nThe trajectory will be shaped by the pace of launch activity at the Bowen Orbital Spaceport, the number and scale of satellite programmes that utilise Australian launch capability, the success of early METS entrants in meeting space-grade quality requirements, and the development of a local supply chain that can serve multiple space operators. The long-term opportunity is substantial — establishing a qualified local supply chain for space manufacturing and operations could position the Greater Whitsunday region as a regional hub for space industry services across the Asia-Pacific.",
      "10": "Strategic implications include focusing on standards readiness as the primary enabler — helping METS businesses understand, navigate, and achieve space-grade accreditations is the single most important action. Supplier accreditation pathways, modelled on defence industry precedents, should be developed with government and industry support. Targeted manufacturing entry points should be identified where existing METS capability aligns most directly with space requirements.\n\nThe space sector requires patience and strategic investment — the near-term opportunity is smaller than mining or renewable energy, but the long-term growth trajectory and the capability spillovers into defence, advanced manufacturing, and other high-standards industries make it a valuable diversification pathway. METS businesses should approach space as a capability accelerator rather than expecting immediate large-scale revenue, building quality systems and accreditations that have value across multiple high-standards sectors."

      "1": "This sector includes planning, remediation, closure engineering, and transition solutions for post-mining land use, including environmental restoration and repurposing for new productive uses. Worldwide, approximately 1,000 mines are expected to close over the decade to 2032. Estimates of annual expenditure on mine closure and remediation activities in Australia range from $4 billion to $8 billion between 2023 and 2040, with peak Bowen Basin mine closure periods expected in 2040 and 2070. The Australian market for environmental remediation technologies and services for mining was worth $800 million in 2020 and is estimated to grow to $3 billion by 2040.\n\nAs decades-old mines close across Queensland — exemplified by the 2023 closure of Glencore's Newlands Coal mine near Glenden — significant opportunities exist to transition to post-mining land uses that realise both commercially and environmentally beneficial outcomes. Australia-wide, a quarter of METS businesses are already offering mine closure and remediation solutions, with many located in the Greater Whitsunday region. The sector is identified across multiple analyses as being central to METS diversification due to the sector's strong entrepreneurial and problem-solving capabilities.",
      "2": "Drivers include rising closure liabilities as mines age and approach end-of-life, increasing regulatory scrutiny of rehabilitation standards and outcomes, and the sheer scale of mining assets approaching closure over the coming decades. Community expectations around environmental restoration are strengthening, while the economic case for beneficial post-mining land uses — rather than minimal compliance-driven rehabilitation — is becoming clearer.\n\nThe Queensland Government's Office of the Mine Rehabilitation Commissioner has completed a series of technical studies related to post-mining land use, largely concentrated on opportunities in the Bowen Basin. Current best practice emphasises proactive action including progressive rehabilitation, regular monitoring, and planning services during the mine's operational period. This highlights the opportunity for METS businesses to begin positioning now — while mines are still operating — rather than waiting for closure announcements. The Bowen Basin's peak closure period in 2040 provides a 15-year planning horizon for capability development.",
      "3": "The sector supports economic resilience by converting closure obligations into new land-use value, reducing long-term liabilities and enabling new economic activity on previously mined land. The economic role is twofold: first, providing the technical services required for safe and effective mine closure and rehabilitation (a large and growing market in its own right); second, enabling the transition to productive post-mining uses that create ongoing economic activity and employment.\n\nThe 2023 Enviromets Queensland survey of post-mining land use stakeholders found that the three challenges considered easiest to address were access to a skilled and capable workforce, capabilities in environmental rehabilitation, and available technical knowledge — all areas of strength for METS businesses. This suggests the sector's growth is not fundamentally constrained by capability but by regulatory, coordination, and commercial model challenges that can be addressed through targeted policy and industry action.",
      "4": "The value chain includes early planning and assessment (determining optimal post-mining land uses), progressive rehabilitation during mine operations, formal closure works, monitoring and compliance verification, and transition to new land uses. Alternative post-mining land uses with regional potential include renewable energy and storage facilities, agriculture and agroforestry, aquaculture and dam utilisation, industrial parks and science precincts, regenerative cropping, protected horticulture, intensive livestock, waste processing and bioreactor facilities, and advanced manufacturing precincts.\n\nVeolia's 6,000-hectare Woodlawn Eco Precinct — located on the former Woodlawn zinc and copper mine near Canberra — provides an international benchmark. It comprises a bioenergy plant recovering clean energy from landfill, a 48.3 MW wind farm, a 2.5 MW solar farm, along with agriculture, aquaculture, and horticulture operations. This demonstrates the multi-use potential of well-planned post-mining transitions and the scale of economic activity that can be generated from sites that might otherwise remain as rehabilitation liabilities.",
      "5": "Capability requirements include environmental and engineering services, earthmoving and heavy equipment operation, compliance and monitoring systems, and cross-stakeholder planning capability. Geological mapping and surveying, site assessment, safety and environmental compliance, hydrology and water management, and earthmoving all align with existing METS strengths. Business innovation and environmental compliance and regulation capabilities are high-alignment areas where METS businesses can lead.\n\nModerate alignment exists for soil analysis and amelioration, erosion and sediment control, assessment of alternative land uses, and environmental engineering. The primary capability gap is in ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation, which requires specialist environmental science skills not typically held within METS businesses. However, this gap can be addressed through partnerships with environmental consulting firms and universities rather than requiring METS businesses to develop these capabilities internally.",
      "6": "Key constraints include unclear risk allocation — there is reluctance among stakeholders to explore post-mining uses beyond simply rehabilitating land to its previous state, with a lack of clarity about which party carries ongoing risk associated with post-mining uses. This acts as a fundamental barrier for METS businesses seeking to develop innovative solutions. Limited incentives for innovative end uses compound this, with Queensland regulations historically mandating rehabilitation approaches that offer limited encouragement to explore alternatives beyond grazing and native vegetation.\n\nScaling challenges are significant — international experience indicates that profit margins for post-mining land uses are often minimal at the outset, frequently requiring significant government support to expand, achieve scale, and drive down costs. Stakeholders have noted the large scale of mine sites and the importance of being able to scale pilot processes in ways that achieve commerciality. Knowledge gaps exist across most stakeholders in understanding the limitations and expectations when transitioning former mine sites, including the technical constraints across environmental, social, and community dimensions.",
      "7": "The workforce includes environmental specialists, engineers, earthmoving and site operations roles, and planning professionals. At the initial closure stages, geological mapping, site assessment, soil analysis, environmental management, and water management skills are primary requirements. As sites transition to new uses, the workforce requirements diversify to include the specific skills of the post-mining activity — renewable energy installation, agricultural operations, industrial construction, or ecological management.\n\nMultiple reports and subject matter experts have consistently highlighted the pivotal role of the METS sector in facilitating post-mining solutions, attributing this to the sector's robust entrepreneurial spirit and problem-solving capabilities. Beyond existing mine closure service providers, the wider METS sector needs to be informed about prospects for innovation in the post-mining domain, especially through enhanced access to mine sites where opportunities can be identified and developed.",
      "8": "Enabling conditions include clarity on post-closure risk allocation and liability transfer, access to mine sites for assessment and planning (both during operations and after closure), multi-stakeholder planning processes that engage Indigenous communities, local government, environmental agencies, and industry, and regulatory arrangements that actively support beneficial post-mining land uses rather than defaulting to minimal rehabilitation.\n\nSpecific priorities include continuing to advocate for clear regulations supporting economic diversification in post-mining land use, connecting METS businesses to information about new economic models and legislative compliance requirements, developing regional strategic planning frameworks to guide potential post-mining activities, identifying scalable multi-site and site-specific options, and collaborating with stakeholders to propose options for targeted government incentive schemes that encourage innovative outcomes taking advantage of strategic assets created by mining activities.",
      "9": "Maturity progresses from compliance-led rehabilitation (where the sector largely sits today in Queensland), to integrated closure planning during mine operations, to innovative multi-use post-mining precinct development. The compliance-led approach — rehabilitating to grazing land or native vegetation — captures minimal value from the significant infrastructure and land assets that mines create. Integrated closure planning, emerging as best practice, begins transition planning years before closure and progressively rehabilitates during operations.\n\nThe most advanced maturity stage involves designing post-mining precincts that leverage mine infrastructure — roads, power, water, cleared land, and structural assets — for new productive uses. The Woodlawn Eco Precinct demonstrates this at international scale. For the Greater Whitsunday region, the 2040 peak closure period in the Bowen Basin provides the timeline — the next 15 years should be used to develop the capability, regulatory frameworks, and commercial models needed to capture maximum value from mine transitions.",
      "10": "Strategic implications include prioritising early planning — the greatest value is captured when post-mining planning begins during mine operations, not after closure announcements. Clarifying risk allocation and regulatory incentives is essential to unlock private investment in innovative post-mining uses. Building cross-stakeholder coordination capacity is critical given the complexity of multi-site scaling across diverse land uses.\n\nThe METS sector should be positioned as a central capability provider for post-mining transitions, leveraging its engineering, fabrication, environmental, and problem-solving strengths. Collaboration with Indigenous communities, environmental scientists, agricultural specialists, and renewable energy developers will be needed to design and deliver multi-use precincts. The region's strategy should treat post-mining land use not as an end-of-mine obligation but as a significant economic opportunity — one that starts now through progressive rehabilitation and early planning, and scales through the Bowen Basin closure wave beginning in 2040."
