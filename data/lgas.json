Combined economy with Isaac and Whitsunday; gross regional product close to $30bn (~6% of Queensland's economy). Over two million visitors and over $2bn visitor expenditure in 2023; 10% of Queensland agricultural production and 28% of Australia's sugarcane production; unemployment rate 3.9%; largest metallurgical coal deposits in Australia; Paget Industrial Estate described as the largest mining services industrial precinct in the southern hemisphere. METS base: estimated 700+ businesses; Paget ~40% of METS businesses; Mackay City ~12% with high share of technical consulting.
