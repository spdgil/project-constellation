## About page and living context for the Project Constellation

**Purpose of this file:**  
This is a living narrative that supports the About page and keeps shared context over time. It is designed to be updated as the product, partnerships, and operating model evolve.

**Tone and language:**  
Warm, professional, restrained. British English spelling. No hype.

## 1. What Project Constellation is

Project Constellation is a place-and-project system designed to support a project development facility.

It helps users see:

- where Queensland has credible economic opportunities that are not yet investable
- what is preventing capital from flowing
- which constraints repeat across places and opportunity types
- which development actions would most efficiently move projects forward

It is not a reporting dashboard for its own sake. It is an instrument for disciplined project maturation.

## 2. The organising idea

The dashboard exists to make one claim legible:

**Queensland’s economy often has the ingredients for growth, but projects stall before they become investable.  
The project development facility exists to close that gap.**

---

## 3. How it works (three objects)

### 3.1 Places (LGAs)
LGAs are the organising unit for place-based context.

An LGA view answers:
- What is true about this place?
- What capabilities exist?
- What constraints show up repeatedly?
- What opportunity hypotheses are plausible here?

LGAs are not “ranked”. They are contexts.

### 3.2 Opportunity types (taxonomy)
Opportunity types are the mechanism for comparing like-with-like across places.

An opportunity type view answers:
- What kind of opportunity is this?
- How does it typically become investable?
- Where is it showing up across Queensland?
- Where does it stall, and why?

Opportunity types allow replication and pattern learning.

### 3.3 Deals (projects)
Deals are the concrete units of progress.

A deal view answers:
- What is the project?
- What stage is it at?
- What is the single most binding constraint?
- What is the next action that would move it one step forward?

Deals are evidence and work-in-progress. They are not endorsements.

## 4. Two diligence pathways

### 4.1 LGA-level diligence (market opportunity)
This pathway defines opportunity hypotheses grounded in place conditions.

Outputs:
- 3–7 opportunity hypotheses per LGA
- a short list of candidate deal exemplars
- repeated constraints observed in the LGA context

### 4.2 Deal-level diligence (project maturation)
This pathway matures specific deals through progressive diligence.

Outputs:
- readiness state on a shared ladder
- one dominant constraint
- a concrete next step
- an audit trail of what changed and why

---

## 5. Readiness and constraints (discipline)

### 5.1 Capital readiness ladder
Deals and clusters are classified on one ladder:

1. No viable projects  
2. Conceptual interest  
3. Feasibility underway  
4. Structurable but stalled  
5. Investable with minor intervention  
6. Scaled and replicable

### 5.2 One dominant constraint only
Every deal and cluster has exactly one dominant constraint at any moment.

The constraint is the reason capital is not flowing today, not a list of everything that is hard.

Secondary issues belong in notes.

---

## 6. What “good” looks like

The dashboard is working when it:

- reduces ambiguity about why opportunities stall
- surfaces repeatable patterns across places
- makes it easier to choose interventions with spillover benefits
- provides a clear, auditable view of pipeline movement over time
- keeps the initial interface calm, with detail earned on interaction

---

## 7. What this dashboard is not

- A promise of funding
- A ranking system for LGAs
- A substitute for investment due diligence
- A platform for lobbying or promotional content
- A forecasting engine

---

## 8. About page structure (recommended)

### Section A — Purpose
A short paragraph explaining that the dashboard supports a project development facility by identifying where projects stall before investment.

### Section B — How to read the dashboard
Explain the three objects (LGA, opportunity type, deal) and how users navigate between them.

### Section C — Method
Explain:
- two diligence pathways
- readiness ladder
- dominant constraint rule
- progressive disclosure design

### Section D — Governance and data
State that:
- deals are included as evidence, not endorsements
- classifications are updated over time and logged
- content may be incomplete and is designed to be improved

### Section E — Contact and contributions
How partners can suggest:
- a deal exemplar
- a missing opportunity type
- an evidence correction

---

## 9. Governance rules (to keep it credible)

1. **No orphan deals**  
   Every deal must belong to one opportunity type and link to an LGA context.

2. **No promotional language**  
   Deal descriptions use neutral, descriptive language.

3. **No returns claims**  
   Do not publish IRR, valuation, or investment recommendations.

4. **One constraint only**  
   If a team cannot agree on the dominant constraint, the project stays in “conceptual” until clarified.

5. **Audit changes**  
   Changes to readiness state and constraint require a short reason note.
