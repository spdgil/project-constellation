# Page Layout

The root layout (`app/layout.tsx`) provides `max-w-screen-2xl` and horizontal padding. Page components must not add their own max-width constraints.

## Width

- **Never** add `max-w-4xl`, `max-w-5xl`, or similar on page containers.
- The only exception is `max-w-prose` for long-form text pages (e.g. About).

```tsx
// ❌ BAD
<div className="max-w-4xl">

// ✅ GOOD — fills available width from root layout
<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
```

## Compact Headers

Page headings use a single-line subtitle, not multi-line paragraphs.

```tsx
// ❌ BAD — verbose intro taking multiple lines
<h1 className="font-heading text-2xl ...">Title</h1>
<p className="mt-2 text-sm text-[#6B6B6B] leading-relaxed max-w-prose">
  The project development pathway progresses from the establishment of an
  enabling environment and initial concept definition through to detailed
  feasibility, structuring, and final transaction execution...
</p>

// ✅ GOOD — compact single-line subtitle
<h1 className="font-heading text-2xl ...">Title</h1>
<p className="mt-1 text-sm text-[#6B6B6B]">
  Five stages from enabling environment through to financial close.
</p>
```

## Two-Column Layout

Detail pages split content into primary (2/3) and secondary (1/3) columns on `md:` and above. Single-column on mobile.

```tsx
<div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 md:gap-8 gap-6">
  <div className="md:col-span-2 space-y-3">
    {/* Primary content */}
  </div>
  <div className="md:col-span-1 bg-[#FAF9F7] border border-[#E8E6E3] p-4 space-y-3 self-start">
    {/* Secondary / reference content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

## Sidebar Card

Secondary content lives in a sidebar card with the warm cream background:

`bg-[#FAF9F7] border border-[#E8E6E3] p-4 self-start`

Use `self-start` so the card does not stretch to match the primary column height.

## Sticky Navigation

When a page has navigation the user needs while scrolling (e.g. a stage stepper), make it sticky:

`sticky top-0 z-10 bg-[#FAF9F7]`

## Single Navigation Paradigm

Never present two controls that navigate the same content. If a stepper selects a stage, do not also wrap each stage in an accordion.
